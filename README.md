Intro
---------------------
Espers is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic token system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own tokens and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
---------------------
You need the Qt5.5.1 run-time libraries to run Espers-Qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:
	`sudo apt-get install libqtgui5`
